# Multigroup cross-section & precursor data for the CNRS benchmark
(Tiberga et al., 2020)

```feedback.py``` applies the salt thermal expansion feedback on the relevant
diffusion coefficients and cross-sections based on the formula provided by
Tiberga et al.

```benchmark_CHIT.txt``` is a duplicate of ```benchmark_CHIP.txt``` because
Moltres requires CHIT cross sections even if it doesn't use them.
